<hr>
    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Innovation seems to be moving faster than ever and there is no place where that is more evident than in schools. Gone are the days of monstrously large projectors that needed to be wheeled out and bulky computers. They’ve long been replaced by tablets, smart boards and interactive apps.

       <br> However, as the boxy TV on wheels dragged into classrooms of yesteryear, the tech filling schools today will one day be outdated. With the likes of artificial intelligence, virtual reality and wearable technology advancing each year, what does the future have in store for us?</p>

            As a term, brain-computer interface (BCI) sounds intimidating. However, this non-invasive technology is making amazing things possible around the world. It’s giving those who can’t speak their voice back, and helping those who can’t move their arms to do incredible things like playing chess.
            
            This is all done via a wearable device, turning brain waves into signals that a computer or mechanical device can interpret. While some of these devices can be implanted, giving better access to the brain, many of the newer devices are non-invasive.
            
            <br><br>They also don’t have to be for anything as major as giving someone their voice back, many BCI devices offer simple uses to boost productivity. For example, there are now wearables, like headphones or small headsets that also act as a brain-computer interface, tracking productivity throughout the day to examine the bumps and dips of when we work best.
        <br>
        This kind of technology has been proposed for schools to help students achieve their best working conditions. Teachers could track when their students need a break, when a maths problem has pushed them too hard or when a certain student is experiencing severe anxiety with the work they are completing.
